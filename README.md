# Tweet_Classification
A) Collect random 1,000 tweets on twitter which asks for and provide any Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) publicly, this could be contact information, phone number, email etc. You decide 3 of the
PIIs and collect data for that. Categorise these tweets into two following categories:
1) Tweets which ask for PII
2) Tweets which provide PII
Analyse the users of these categories using their profile and network to further classify benign and
spam/malicious users from them. You should use machine learning techniques which have been
discussed in class; pick any that is appropriate to the task and justify the same. You have to submit the
following:
- Your code files with documentation and database
- Your report with all the analysis and data description
- A text file with with User Ids of all spam/malicious users you have detected
