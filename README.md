# Tweet_Classification
A) Collect random 1,000 tweets on twitter which asks for and provide any Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) publicly, this could be contact information, phone number, email etc. You decide 3 of the
PIIs and collect data for that. Categorise these tweets into two following categories:
1) Tweets which ask for PII
2) Tweets which provide PII
Analyse the users of these categories using their profile and network to further classify benign and
spam/malicious users from them. You should use machine learning techniques which have been
discussed in class; pick any that is appropriate to the task and justify the same. You have to submit the
following:
- Your code files with documentation and database
- Your report with all the analysis and data description
- A text file with with User Ids of all spam/malicious users you have detected

B) Collect random 1,000 images from Instagram and analyse if they have any malicious content
(violence, adult content). You can use any existing API to analyse images for the content in the image,
text in the image, etc. You need to further utilise the features like image tags, their location, user profile
who posted it to analyse the characteristics of such images from benign ones.
You have to submit the following:
- Upload your dataset on drive and provide link in your report. Please keep separate folders for
malicious and benign images which you have classified.
- Your code files with proper documentation
- Your report explaining methodology, data and analysis

C) Collect 100 profiles from Jeevansathi.com. (You would need to scrape the data and create an
account). Cross reference / compare these profiles with Facebook or Twitter accounts by doing feature
extraction. Goal is to identify profiles on FB / Twitter which are same as the ones in Jeenvansathi. You
donâ€™t need to give the accurate account but 3 most possible accounts should be fine too; if you can find
the accurate ones that is great.
You have to submit the following:
- CSV file with the 100 profiles in 1 column, FB profiles in the next column, and Twitter profiles in
the 3rd column.
- Code with proper documentation
- Dataset
- Report explaining methodology, data and analysis
